					I like this course.I have learnt a lot in it.My quarantine has been productive so far, hopefully I can keep this mindset. I am not sure what i am gonna be doing after this course. But I am sure that i am going to do something productive. I am keeping in touch with my friends they all seem to be learning stuff similar to this. I cannot wait for college to start to meet my friends. This vacation helped me realize the people I am truly close to and who regard me as their friends.
